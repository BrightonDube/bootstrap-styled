In bootstrap-styled we provide you with a few different tools so that you can customize and share theme quickly and easily.

The first is an object that groups all of the already popular variables of bootstrap v4.
These are all listed [here](#/Variable%20lists) and retain all of the advantages given by bootstrap.  You can also find them
in action and listed in actual [components](https://github.com/bootstrap-styled/v4).

The object is present by default in the `BootstrapProvider`. That means that you can use it without even applying a theme to it.
